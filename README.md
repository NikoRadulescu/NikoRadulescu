Find a dynamic and stimulating work environment where I can apply my skills, creativity, and knowledge to their fullest potential. As a professional Data Analyst and BI Engineer, I am committed to continual growth and development in these fields, and am eager to take on new challenges and expand my expertise.

### PROJECTS:

- 2022: [**Dukier.com: View 360**](https://dukier.com) is a project, that I have worked on, that brings together the most important metrics from Meta, TikTok, and Google Ads, and integrates them into Google BigQuery. View 360 consists of a dashboard using Looker Studio, providing real-time insights that are essential for growing their brand and optimizing their advertising spend. Dukier gains access to valuable data from multiple sources, allowing them to better understand their audience, measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns, and identify areas for improvement;

- 2022: [**Tableau for data mining**](https://github.com/NikoRadulescu/Tableau-for-Data-Mining): Using public data, as a data scientist, my task was to analyze bank customer data spanning over a 6-month period and determine why customers are leaving the bank. Using Tableau Public, I created an interactive dashboard that provided a clear picture of the underlying issues driving customer attrition. This project could help banks to better understand why customers are leaving and provides actionable insights to help reduce churn rates, allowing for informed decision-making and improved customer retention strategies;

- 2021: [**Google Marketing Platform: Firebase Hosting, GTM, GA4, BigQuery**](https://github.com/NikoRadulescu/Firebase-Hosting-GTM-GA4-BigQuery): I made this project/video using several powerful tools from Google Marketing Platform (Firebase Hosting, Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics 4) and Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery). With these tools, you can create an effective landing page and track user behavior on your website - what most of the digital companies would need;

- 2021: [**Dashboarding: NY Bike Trips, International Country Census**](https://github.com/NikoRadulescu/BigQuery-with-Data-Studio-Case-study-Covid19): using GCP BigQuery, I analyzed public CovidData dataset for NY Bike Trips and International Country Census. My goal was to create an informative dashboard using GMP Data Studio, with a special focus on CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations data;
